My name is Dylan Arbuthnot. I was born and raised in Arizona though I have lived all around the southern region of the state. I have two cats, a dog, a corn snake, and an ornate uromastyx at home. Lasagna is my favorite food. Yes... like Garfield. And yes... I do hate Mondays.

Favorite Movie: Stardust
